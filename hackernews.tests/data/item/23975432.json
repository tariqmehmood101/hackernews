However, tuition at every school I&#x27;ve looked at is significantly higher because of out of state costs and I&#x27;d likely have to go into a bit of debt as I only have 4 years of school money stowed away.<p>Is this worth it or should I remain where I am debt free?","time":1595942459,"title":"Ask HN: Should I transfer to an online BS?","type":"story"}
