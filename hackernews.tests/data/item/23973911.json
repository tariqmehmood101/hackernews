We are close to launching our platform. While you may be able to glean quite a bit from our website, a lot of the functionality requires registration. So, instead, I want to explain here the premise of our platform.<p>Having a workforce that works from home on a long-term basis can have productivity, financial, security, privacy, Intellectual Property (IP) and legal implications (see partial list here: www.wizathome.com&#x2F;employers). In addition, the old model of surveillance of employees (such as capturing screen shots, keyboard logging, always-on camera etc.) will no longer make sense â€“ for example, how do you prevent a WFH employee browsing on a personal device placed next to company issued laptop?<p>With WFH trends only expected to rise, employees will become more and more like free agents. Also, flex hours will become the norm, rather than an exception. All of this requires a new paradigm in dealing with employees: One based on trust, and mutual buy-in of personalized policies and goals (integrated with those of the organization), to enhance both productivity and individual employee&#x27;s well-being.","time":1595928136,"title":"Show HN: SaaS platform to bring out the best in Work-From-Home (WFH) workforce","type":"story"}
