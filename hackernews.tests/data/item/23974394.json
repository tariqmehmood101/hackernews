After a merger, he is now the CTO of a company with an existing developer team.<p>The struggle we are facing now:<p>- He is not responsive at all, neither via chat, nor email, nor any other communication tool. So we often have to write him via chat &quot;Please look at this PR, I left some comments&quot; etc...<p>- He doesn&#x27;t know how to delegate and often says &quot;I&#x27;ll do it&quot; but then it takes weeks to finish<p>- He has thousands of unread emails in his inbox<p>- When he writes tickets, the details are often unclear and hard to follow for other developers<p>- He codes way too much for a CTO, in my opinion, and his code is a bit messy compared to the other developers<p>Since he is a really nice person, we all want to give him feedback that makes him understand his role better, and to become more efficient and avoid being a bottleneck.<p>Has anyone struggled with this in the past, and found a solution, or at least a way to see small, but steady improvements? I know that changing another person is one of the hardest things one can attempt to do, but at the same time I know that he is motivated to become a good CTO, but currently just doesn&#x27;t know how yet.","time":1595933861,"title":"Ask HN: How can we teach our CTO to understand his new role?","type":"story"}
