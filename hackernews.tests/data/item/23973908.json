Most of the feedback I got back was around the UI&#x2F;UX.<p>I have since then sat down and started a redesign of NearBeach. Some changes have been;\n- Implementation of VueJS with the Django Framework\n- Implementing basic instructions into each form\n- Improvement of accessibility\n- Improvement of loading times<p>At the moment, I am taking the LEAN approach and only focusing on one form - the New Requirements form. Would it be possible to get some feedback on the new design?<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;test.nearbeach.org<p>Username: basicuser\nPassword: 1234BasicUser<p>Thank you very much :)\nAny and all feedback is appreciated","time":1595928123,"title":"Ask HN: Have I improved my side project's UI/UX","type":"story"}
