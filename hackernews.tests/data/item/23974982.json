Things were fine until the placement season came and most of my friends ended up joining MNCs. Although my startup offered me a salary compeititive to Microsoft &#x2F; Amazon at that time, Now I feel like I&#x27;m missing out on a lot. \nI see them getting better Macbooks, with lots of perks (monetary &amp; non-monetary), and to some level this bothers me.\nThe work that I do at this startup, I like it, I get to make my impact faster, code ships to production fast enough (as I&#x27;m the one deploying the code to the server), it does feel like I am a step back from everyone, I get almost no perks as compared to what other get. Also, the work isn&#x27;t structured much, there is not much focus on code reviews here, since projects get handled by single developers here most of the time. So for eg, right now I handle the entire backend code of the project I&#x27;ve been assigned to, so I can obviously make things better by me, by following code quality practices, but that isn&#x27;t the point here. \nPeople have been telling me continuously that WORK &gt; PERKS, but I cannot make up my mind around that, I still feel a little bit like a loser.\nMy question is, Is it all worth it in the end ? Will this work be beneficial for me ?","time":1595939273,"title":"Ask HN: No-FAANG-like-Perks, is it worth it?","type":"story"}
