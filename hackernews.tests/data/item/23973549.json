Things have been going well, but an interview yesterday included a (virtual equivalent) whiteboard coding exercise.<p>Now, I’m not a huge fan of these and don’t use them in my own hiring. But as a dev of ~15y experience, still very much hands on, I should be able to handle it.<p>I found myself drawing an absolute blank. The exercise was nothing too complicated really, but the brain would simply not engage. <i>Nothing</i> was working.<p>As interviews go it was the worst experience I’ve ever had - I spent maybe twenty minutes in this blocked state but it felt like forever.<p>So I’m now feeling pretty depressed about job prospects, coding ability, my capability as a human being etc. Sharing or talking about a problem always helps to process it, so I thought 1. Why not do that with anonymous internet strangers, and 2. Why not provide a place for people to do the same. So it would be great if people felt able to share their stories too.<p>And for those of you also unexpectedly back in the job market: best of luck, you <i>will</i> get there.","time":1595924254,"title":"Interview Nightmares","type":"story"}
